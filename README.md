Insights :-
1. Top Sales Contributors
   
Ches Bonnell and Obv Sorrel are the top-performing salespersons, each generating close to $300K in revenue.

The Top 10 salespersons all contribute significantly, with even the lowest among them (Marnev O’Breen) bringing in substantial revenue above $200K.

A strong salesforce is a clear driver of revenue consistency.

2. Sales Trend Over Time

Sales exhibit monthly fluctuations, with a dip in February and March, followed by a peak around June.

This may indicate seasonal trends (possibly due to holidays or promotional campaigns) that can be leveraged further.

3. Brand Revenue Distribution

Revenue is well distributed across multiple brands: Cadbury’s, Hershey’s, Ghirardelli, Lindt, and Reese’s.

No single brand dominates completely, suggesting diverse customer preferences and balanced product performance.

4. Country-Wise Sales Performance

Australia leads in total sales, followed closely by the UK, India, and USA.

New Zealand has the lowest sales among the tracked countries, highlighting a potential area for market growth or strategic marketing focus.

5. Business Scale Metrics

The business has achieved $6.18M in revenue, shipped 177,007 boxes, across 1,094 shipments — indicating a high-volume, global operation.

Efficiency in logistics is key to maintaining this scale.
